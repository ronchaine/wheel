#### What is it?
It is _not working_.  Most parts won't work yet -- use at your own caution.
Stable branches will be made after they are ready for it.

#### No really, what is it?
It is a framework library.  Or an application/game engine engine.  A newer take on my old Wheel library.  It is still very much a
work in progress, but it is usable enough for me not to focus on it too much at the moment.  Some other projects that I am fighting with
use this, so if there are any decent improvements on the way, they will be added to this repository as well.  Texture atlasing and image loading
should be on their way at some point.

#### Troubleshooting
OS X requires libc++ as standard library, the stdlibc++ provided by Apple lacks required C++11 functionality.
